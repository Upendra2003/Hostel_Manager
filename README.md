# Hostel Manager

Welcome to Hostel Manager! This web application is designed to help manage various hostel-related tasks such as outpass requests, complaints, notices, and finding roommates. It has been developed using the Flask framework.

## Features

- **Outpass Requests**: Students can submit outpass requests online, providing the necessary details such as date, time, reason, etc. The requests can be reviewed and approved/rejected by the hostel authorities.

- **Complaints**: Students can file complaints regarding any issues they face in the hostel. The complaints are recorded and can be assigned to the concerned staff members for resolution.

- **Dashboard**: Important notices and announcements can be posted on the notice board for all students to view. The notices can be categorized and sorted by date.

- **Roommate Finder**: Students who are looking for roommates can create profiles and search for suitable roommates based on preferences such as gender, hobbies, interests, etc.
